# SimpleCheckoutSystem
Simple checkout website for walkup &amp; wholesale purchases built in Microsoft's ASP.NET Core MVC framework

This was a project for one of my UT-Austin classes. the goal was to built a simple website that could handle 2 types of customer orders: walkup customers and wholesale customers.

If you would like to actually run the program on your own computer, download the 'Machon_Connor_HW2.sln' file and open with Visual Studio 2019!
